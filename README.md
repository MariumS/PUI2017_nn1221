# PUI2017_nn1221

### Assignment 2

I log on into CUSP compute then I created directory on CUSP compute called PUI2017 using command 
> mkdir PUI2017

The directory is located on the /home/cusp/nn1221/PUI2017

I saved it in .bashrc and created alias using command:

> export PUI2017="/home/cusp/nn1221/PUI2017"

That export command is for exporting PUI2017 in '/home/cusp/nn1221/PUI2017' directory.

> alias pui2017="cd $PUI2017"

The command is for call the PUI2017 directory using pui2017 alias.
