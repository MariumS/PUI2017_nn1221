### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
**H0** : The percentage change in BMI of people in the diet sample is significantly same or lower than the percentagechange in Bmi of people in the excercise sample after x year(s).
Pt <= Pc
**Ha** : The percentage change in BMI of people in the diet sample is significantly higher than the percentage change in BMI of people in the excercise sample after x year(s).
Pt > Pc

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

**H0** : The average IQ of children t ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 whose parents smoked at least X cigarette(s) during pregnancy is same or higher than the average IQ of children whose parents did not smoke durimg pregnancy. 
Pt 
**Ha** : The average IQ of children t ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 whose parents smoked at least X cigarette(s) during pregnancy is lower than the average IQ of children whose parents did not smoke durimg pregnancy. 

**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

**H0** : 
**H1** :
