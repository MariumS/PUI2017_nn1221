1. I download the pluto data and convert the table attributes to csv using QGIS then upload it to github so it can be accessible and reproducible. While the energy data I download it using `pd.read_csv()` on Jupyter notebook.
2. I did data munging and data cleaning all by myself.
3. I did the regression part by my self then found a problem with the plotting because of log conversion, so I asked Ben Steers help to fix my plotting. He also explained me about the next step, which is chi2 and polynomial.
