# Homework 1

This homework 1 located under PUI2017_nn1221 directory and consist of 3 assignments.

### Assignment 1
The first assignment is to continue the first lab and it is located in the different repository, which is https://github.com/ninanrh/gittest_nn1221 and fork and mess https://github.com/ninanrh/gittest_uc288 repository.

### Assignment 2
The second assignment is to create new directory called `PUI2017_nn1221` and created an environmental variable `PUI2017` that points to the directory and create `pui2017` alias. The step I took for assignment 2 is here:

First, I log on into CUSP compute then I created directory on CUSP compute called PUI2017 using command 
`mkdir PUI2017`

The directory is located on the `/home/cusp/nn1221/PUI2017`

I then saved it in .bashrc and created alias using command:
`export PUI2017="/home/cusp/nn1221/PUI2017"`
That export command is for exporting PUI2017 as `/home/cusp/nn1221/PUI2017` directory.

I then created the alias using this command `alias pui2017="cd $PUI2017"`.
